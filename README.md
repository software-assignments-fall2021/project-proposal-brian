# Chef Story (Project Proposal)
By Brian Rios(bjr366)

### What and why?
Many college students are getting their first ever kitchen, but don’t have the faintest idea what to do with it. Some are too intimidated by the cooking process, while others are discouraged by countless cooking catastrophes. 
I propose a platform solely dedicated to home-cooked recipes, in which younger generations can upload recipes along with pictures and short videos. This application will combine these uploads into “stories”, which have been all the rage recently. These “Chef Stories” will not only be providing tasty and quick recipes for younger generations, but will do so in a more visual and entertaining way. The brevity of stories is very important as it will attract visual learners, like myself, who would rather not waste time reading or watching long YouTube tutorials.
This is meant to make the lives of college students easier, helping them save tons of money that would have otherwise been spent eating out, and being far healthier in the process. This platform will be driven by those passionate in preparing home cooked meals, and consumed by a massive audience with a lack of inspiration.

### For whom?
I mentioned college students as my consumer base, but all young people around the same age(17-27) are also target users. I also want to include as many ethnicities and cultures as possible.

### How?
Users who seek education and entertainment will be able to browse a variety of cuisines that peak their interest, through a home newsfeed, search, and filter. User connections can be made to create a sense of community. Transitioning through and in-between recipe stories should be seamless. Users will be able to like, comment, and reply to comments for each story. Each user has an opportunity to personalize their own accounts: profile picture, user info, and hopefully Bitmoji integration. Each user can post any cooking content without formal boundaries. For instance, being able to post humiliating cooking experiences, and adding video clips of friends taste-testing the food of the user. I want to make this app as fun as possible and easy to use. I am also open to any suggestions.

### Scope
This recipe app/social media platform will be an interesting challenge to take on, yet feasible. At this point, most of us already have an idea of how user data can be managed in the backend. While most of us are not familiar with creating graphical user interfaces, this project is meant to have a minimalist design. With applications like SnapChat, Instagram, and Facebook, who have already integrated stories into their platforms, the developers that would work on this solution already have a strong visualization of what the end goal is.
